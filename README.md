TyphiNET is a dashboard for visualising global _Salmonella_ Typhi genotype and antimicrobial resistance data, as described in the paper [Dyson et al, Genome Medicine 2025](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13073-025-01470-4). 

Typhi genome and source data are curated by the [Global Typhoid Genomics Consortium](https://www.typhoidgenomics.org/) using [Typhi Pathogenwatch](https://pathogen.watch/), as described in [Carey et al, 2023](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.85867). Data displayed in the TyphiNET dashboard are filtered to include only genomes from unbiased sampling frames; e.g. routine or project-based enteric fever surveillance, as opposed to AMR-focused sampling or outbreak investigations.

The TyphiNET dashboard is available at: [https://www.typhi.net](https://www.typhi.net)
